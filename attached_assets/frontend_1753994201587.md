# Frontend Documentation

## Primary Users
- Internal consultants and solution architects at Technologent

## User Interface Design
The frontend will focus on usability for data-intensive tasks and efficient report generation.

### 1. Inventory Management Interface
- **Tabular layout**: Primary view consists of sortable, filterable data tables
- **Columns include**: Circuit ID, Carrier, Location, Service Type, Bandwidth, Cost, Contract Term, etc.
- **Bulk actions**: Ability to tag, annotate, or export multiple rows
- **Inline editing**: Update cost, notes, or optimization status directly in table rows

### 2. Benchmark Analysis Engine
- **Side-by-side comparison**: Customer circuit data vs. benchmarked pricing/performance
- **Automated flags**: Highlight circuits with high cost-per-Mbps or low redundancy
- **Design Suggestions**:
  - Recommend network redesigns (e.g., shift from MPLS to SD-WAN)
  - Tag circuits with alternative carrier options

### 3. Report Builder
- **Drag-and-drop editor or templated sections**
- **Dynamic content blocks**: Tables, charts, summaries, callouts
- **Branding support**: Add Technologent and customer logos, theme colors
- **Export options**: PDF (primary), with optional HTML for future portal use

### 4. Navigation Structure
- Top nav or sidebar with the following sections:
  - Dashboard (high-level project overview)
  - Inventory (main data table)
  - Audit Flags (auto-generated and manually added)
  - Report Builder
  - Benchmark Settings (internal use)

### 5. Usability Goals
- Prioritize clarity and speed over visual flair
- Designed for large desktop monitors
- Save state across sessions (e.g., filters, column order)

## Framework Recommendation
**React (with TypeScript)** using **TailwindCSS** for styling, providing:
- Flexible component structure
- Fast rendering for large tables
- Clean, modern design system
