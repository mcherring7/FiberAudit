## Purpose
This SaaS application is designed to streamline telecom audit and optimization projects for Technologent's internal consulting team. It centralizes telecom inventory data, facilitates auditing workflows, and produces professional deliverables for end customers.

- Track changes and optimization opportunities
- Generate clean, branded deliverables for clients
- Support future integrations with telecom providers like AT&T, Lumen, Comcast, Zayo, etc.

## Key Features (Initial Scope)
- Internal dashboard for consultants to manage projects
- Telecom circuit and service inventory management
- Audit tracking and opportunity tagging
- Exportable or web-based client deliverables (e.g., dashboards, PDF reports)
- Role-based access control (consultant vs. customer views)

## Target Users
- **Primary Users:** Technologent’s internal consultants and solution architects
- **Secondary Audience:** Enterprise customers (read-only, branded deliverables)

## Future Scope
- API integrations with carrier systems to pull inventory and invoice data
- Analytics and benchmarking modules
